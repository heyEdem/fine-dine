- Restaurant search and discovery based on location, cuisine, and availability.
- Seamless order placement and history tracking.
- Rider assignment, delivery management, and live tracking.
- Efficient and intelligent rider selection based on ETA, ratings, and workload.
- Real-time updates for menus, availability, and order status.

### 1.3 Intended Audience
- **Product Managers** – to understand feature scope.
- **Developers** – to implement backend and frontend components.
- **Test Engineers** – to validate functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Operations** – to manage infrastructure and deployment.

## 5. System Constraints & Assumptions
- All location data uses a standardized geolocation format.
- Payments and tips are handled outside this scope.
- Delivery tracking uses GPS-enabled rider devices.
- Single region/currency for MVP.

---

## 6. Development Guidelines
- Follow **microservices architecture** for modularity.
- Use **REST APIs** for synchronous communication and **WebSockets** for live tracking.
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage using **JUnit** and **Mockito**.
- Implement caching for faster search results.
- Ensure secure communication over HTTPS.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Multi-region and multi-currency support.
- AI-based recommendations for dishes and restaurants.
- Integration with third-party payment gateways.
